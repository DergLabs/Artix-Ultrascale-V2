# Artix-Ultrascale-V2
A custom FPGA development board centered around the AU25P from Xilinx


This project is purely for my own personal enjoyment. I designed this board as a challenge to myself, and boy was it! 

This repo contains the original Altium design files, schematic PDF and a folder containing some of the important datasheets I referenced while designing this board. A substantial amount of reading went into figuring out how to design this board. I may have missed some datasheets because the true number that I've gone through is easily nearing 100+

If you have any questions, do not heistate to reach out to me at "Dragon Ejoyer#1101" on Discord! 

The memory interface and pin-out was determined using Xilinx Vivado. 

Due to the cost, I do not plan on fabricating this board at this time. I cannot guarentee that it works in any way!!! If you decide to fab this board or use the design for yourself, you do so at your own risk. 

The PCB is roughly the size of an iPhone 14 Pro Max, for those who are curious.
